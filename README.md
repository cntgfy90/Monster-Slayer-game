# Monster-Slayer-game
The first game in HTML , CSS and JavaScript


This is my first game which I made using JavaScript and Vue.js library in particular.
Also Foundation css framework was engaged into development and of course plain HTML5 also helped to finally realize this project.

The idea behind is that there are two healthbars and the button 'Start game'. When you click this button, the game starts and another buttons
replace this one: Attack ( both monster and player commit some attacks and the helathbars start to decline ) Special attack ( it is something
like ultimate for player, no actions are commited while ultimate is being used, so it's only player who makes some damage to monster) heal
( you can use this skill only three times during the match ) give up ( you can finish the game and after clicking this button you return to
the main menu where you can click the button 'Start game' again and try yourself one more time )
